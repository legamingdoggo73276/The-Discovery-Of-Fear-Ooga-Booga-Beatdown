Hello, and welcome to our beautiful game, "The Discovery of Fear, Ooga Booga Beatdown"! 

We hope you enjoy playing our game. Please keep in mind that we are all high school programmers, so the game may be a little rough around the edges.

Move using the W A S and D keys, as you would in most PC games. Proceed to the next room by following a path in the cave until you hit the border: 
you should be teleported to the next room. All other game controls are explained in the in-game tutorial given after you enter the first room.

Should you find any bugs or have any other concerns, please contact us!
